SDL2_PS3
-----------

Based on SDL2_PSL1GHT by sergiou87, https://github.com/sergiou87/SDL2_PSL1GHT
Itself based on SDL_PSL1GHT by zeldin, https://github.com/zeldin/SDL_PSL1GHT
Ported to the official Cell SDK by Twilight because there doesn't seem to
be a proper debugger for PSL1GHT.


Build instructions:

- Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (Only VS2010 is supported).
- Install SCE Cell SDK. Be sure to install the VS2010 plugin.
- Open PS3/SDL.sln
- Build and enjoy
